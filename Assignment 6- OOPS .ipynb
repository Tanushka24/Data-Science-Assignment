    "Four Pillars of OOPs are as follows :\n",
    "The four pillars of OOPs are based on the four pillars of programming: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Each pillar provides a different function and helps developers organize their code for better management.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstraction is a form of simplification and organization, allowing developers to focus on the essential parts of their code without focusing on the implementation details. It helps developers create code in a more efficient manner, while still providing the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of combining data and codes into a single unit. It helps keep code organized, as well as helps prevent accidental data manipulation and changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the process of creating new classes based on an existing class. It allows the developer to create subclasses that will inherit the attributes and behaviors of the parent class. This makes it easy to reuse code, making development faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally here in the Four pillars of OOPs, polymorphism is a form of abstraction that allows different classes to fulfill the same behavior. By taking advantage of polymorphism, developers can create code that is more easily maintained and more versatile."

    "The __init__() function is used in object-oriented programming languages, to initialize an object's attributes or properties when it is created from a class. It is also known as a constructor method.\n",

    "The primary purpose of the __init__() function is to set the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes. This allows you to define and customize the initial properties of an object as soon as it is instantiated.

    "Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and behaviors from another class. It allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of each type of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: A class inherits from a single base class. For example, a \"Car\" class can inherit from a \"Vehicle\" class, inheriting attributes and methods related to vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: A class inherits from multiple base classes. For instance, a \"Student\" class can inherit from both a \"Person\" class and a \"Scholarship\" class, inheriting attributes and methods from both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilevel Inheritance: A derived class becomes the base class for another class. For example, a \"Manager\" class can inherit from an \"Employee\" class, and then a \"Director\" class can inherit from the \"Manager\" class, forming a multilevel inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class. For instance, a \"Shape\" class can have derived classes like \"Circle,\" \"Rectangle,\" and \"Triangle,\" which inherit common attributes and methods from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid Inheritance: It is a combination of multiple and hierarchical inheritance. It involves multiple base classes and multiple levels of inheritance. The specific example may vary depending on the requirements of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of inheritance provides flexibility and allows for the creation of class relationships that best fit the problem domain and code organization needs."
